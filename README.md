This is a set of simple JS tasks taken from: https://js.checkio.org/ <br>
For each of them I'm presenting both my solution and the one I find the best (best solutions at checkio are revealed only after you find your own one)<br>
1. Backward string <br>
You should return a given string in reverse order <br>
2. Easy unpack <br>
create a function that gets an array and returns a tuple with 3 elements: the first, third and second element from the last for the given array
3. Remove all before <br>
What you need to do here is to remove from the array all of the elements before the given one.
For the illustration we have a array [3, 4, 5] and we need to remove all elements that go before 3 - which is 1 and 2.
We have two edge cases here: (1) if a cutting element cannot be found, then the array shoudn't be changed. (2) if the array is empty, then it should remain empty.
4. All upper <br>
Check if a given string has all symbols in upper case - then the function should return True. Otherwise it should return False. If the string is empty or doesn't have any letter in it - function should return True.
