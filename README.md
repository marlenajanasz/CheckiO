This is a set of simple JS tasks taken from: https://js.checkio.org/ <br>
For each of them I'm presenting both my solution and the one I find the best (best solutions at checkio are revealed only after you find your own one)<br>
1. Backward string <br>
You should return a given string in reverse order <br>
2. Easy unpack <br>
create a function that gets an array and returns a tuple with 3 elements: the first, third and second element from the last for the given array
